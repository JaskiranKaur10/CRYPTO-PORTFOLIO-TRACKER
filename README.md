# Crypto Portfolio Tracker

## Description

The Crypto Portfolio Tracker is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that allows users to create and manage their cryptocurrency investment portfolios. This Move-based application enables users to track their digital asset holdings, monitor investment amounts, and maintain a comprehensive record of their crypto investments in a secure, on-chain environment.

The smart contract provides two core functionalities:
- **Portfolio Creation**: Users can initialize a new portfolio associated with their account
- **Holdings Management**: Users can add new cryptocurrency holdings with detailed information including token symbols, amounts, and purchase prices

Each portfolio is stored as a resource on the user's account, ensuring data ownership and security while maintaining transparency through blockchain technology.

## Vision

Our vision is to democratize cryptocurrency portfolio management by providing a decentralized, transparent, and user-owned solution for tracking digital asset investments. We aim to eliminate the need for centralized portfolio tracking services by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure:

- **Data Ownership**: Users maintain complete control over their portfolio data
- **Privacy**: No third-party access to sensitive investment information  
- **Transparency**: All transactions and holdings are verifiable on-chain
- **Security**: Leveraging Aptos blockchain's robust security model
- **Accessibility**: Simple, user-friendly interface for crypto investors of all levels

We envision a future where every crypto investor has access to professional-grade portfolio management tools without sacrificing privacy or control over their financial data.
